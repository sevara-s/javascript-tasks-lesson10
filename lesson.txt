In javascript objects are used to store key and values about one object. 
Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

1)Objects literal--> the most common way to create objects 
ex: 
   let person = {
    car_nam ="BMW",
    car_color="black"
   }
2)Object Constructor 
  let person = new Object();
  person.name ="John";
  person.age = 40;




Object constructor funciton is used to create many objects at the same time.
MOst of the time the name of the function is going to start with upper-case letter,

Javascript objects methods:
const obj = {name:Sevara, age:17; job:student}
1) delete obj.name;--> with the help of delete method in javascript we can delete the properties from the object,
2)Object.keys(obj);--> this methods returns the array of key ifrom object.
3)Object.value(obj)-->returns the array of values from object.
4)Object.entries(obj);-->returns key-value pairs in list.
5)
